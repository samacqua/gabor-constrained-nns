This directory contains code to recreate prior results. Visit the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19arSJlLq4TDxKNFte09uX5uI6IH3Yt0m?usp=sharing) to see different variants on running original results, including 
- different gabornet implementations
- different kernel sizes
- different datasets
- different dataset pre-processings (image size, color space)
- different model sizes
- first-layer-frozen variants
